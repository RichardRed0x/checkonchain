# Decred Thesis

## Primary difference between BTC and DCR is the people
- Decentralised cryptonetworks can be thought of as digital organisms with fungi being the best reference organism due to anti-fragile nature.
- Decred competes by instilling a hivemind of people, arguably the only edge that could compete with Bitcoins hardcore incentive and governance structure
- Decred is capable of evolution, adaptation to the environment and self-sustainability

- People keep them alive because the network can pay them to keep it alive. People will pay the network as they get value from it.

- Fundamental difference between BTC and DCR is a) Who the system employs and b) who owns the risk of governance decisions. for **Bitcoin** it employs PoW miners only (100% PoW security spend). Governance for Bitcoin is function of miners, devs and users (holding BTC gives zero governance rights, only running a node). For **Decred** it employs miners, stakers and builders who all have skin in the game.

- **People work for Bitcoin** (game theory focused on independent greed as a motivator supporting the network, people act in self interest)
- **People work with Decred** (hive mind decision making, distributed direction and Treasury to support people). Decred trades off independent greed for collective intelligence regarding risk ownership and decision making.
- Decred promotes accountability, transparency and responsibility in ones actions (human level). Bitcoin promotes acting in ones self interest.

## BTC and DCR Coexist
- Fundamentally a function of risk and hedging
- Bitcoin retains positon as ultimate store of value and global finality. Likely to become such an expensive system it will be unatainable for many, especially in a self-custody solution. 
- Decred revolutionises human organisation and distributed working. The aligned incentives and governance participation reinforce its social contract and sound money value proposition.
- **Bitcoin** approaches sound money from a position of rigidity and conservatism (a feature not a bug). A side effect is slow development and a high likelyhood of early calcification.
- **Decred** is more flexible yet can retain sound money principles. Future is uncertain and BTC calcification may be a strength by also a constrain on use cases. Future uncertainty remains true today as much as it does tomorrow, uncertainty is a constant.


## Decred revolutionises human organisation and incentive structures for decision making
- Transparent and accountable tendering and fund management (public funds, project tendering etc)
- Change the way people work in a distributed system with aligned incentive structures
- Bullish case that Decred becomes a sovereign nation state able to support an increasing pool of contractors

## Bitcoin as a declaration of independence – a true succession of $ from the state
- Decred is the constitution which can be amended to deal with the changing world
- Whilst Bitcoin is the ultimate digital SoV and part of its design is to calcify
- The Future is uncertain (advantage for BTC in one hand). When the time comes for a hard fork, likely it becomes so large and contentious it constrains use
- Decred is available as an infrastructure layer and alternative digital SoV (example is atomic swaps, LN and DEX which improve both BTC and DCR value propositions)

## Unforgeable Costliness
Scarcity of fixed supply assets is fundamentally rooted in cost of production
Bitcoin had the immaculate conception and Distributed Proof of Work

Decred has the initial distribution (developers building btcsuite + bootstrapping PoS). The Production costs require a balance of PoW and 60%+ PoS capture which is 20x more expensive per unit of Market Cap than Bitcoin.

# Decred Value Stack
View Decred as a self-reinforcing value stack
1. Sound money principles from Bitcoin

 2. Security (hybrid bootstraps early network + higher per unit of MC)

3. PoS layer differentiates with governance and risk ownership by holders
    - Effectively transfers decision making to holders rather than anarchy
Acts as fork resistance which will become increasingly important 

4. Social contract pulls increased human mind-share and community retention. Increased trust in the chain + network effects increases DCR value

5. Treasury is then available to support continued evolution into the future

# On-chain research

Monetary premiums was a study against the Bitcoin reference point. Underlying assumption was that Bitcoin has organic data whilst the market had a speculative approach in 2017.
Showed that Decred has both acquired and retains a convincing monetary premium

On-chain analysis – recognition that people are behind the success, failure + performance and need to understand Why DCR has a monetary Premium
1. Analyse the SoV characteristics with a particular focus on ticket behaviour
2. Transaction flows (on-chain and exchanges) as fractals for block-space demand
3. Link to ticket price and Politeia Data as observations of governance/key issues
4. Evolution of the supply distribution (PoS @ 50% of supply yet only 30% from B.Reward. People are buying off market to stake)
5. Faith in the chain – summation of all the above gives the heartbeat of the DCR ledger
