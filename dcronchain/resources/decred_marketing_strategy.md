# Checkmates Crude and Beautiful Marketing Strategy: 

Contractors MUST be the loudest voices on Twitter, currently it feels reclusive in the Matrix safe zone. All non dev contractors need to get involved in the social space and amplify and educate with conviction, you get paid DCR to do this. Present your position, show the justification and then defend it. Don’t be afraid to be professionally scrappy if needed, you can always call for back-up.

The more we shout, the easier it becomes, the harder your arguments get and the less the market will ignore Decred.

The secret sauce is EDUCATION WITH CONVICTION. People want to understand and believe in their investment and Contractors are the single best placed people to have the conviction and the knowledge to educate the masses. 

People want to learn. Get them down the Decred rabbit hole and holding a fraction of a ticket.

## Engage in Social media even on semi-controversial topics
- Debunking a theory or defending it cleanly WILL attract attention and follows

- Do not avoid confrontation, else the project will remain a ghost. 

- Being nice won’t win the war. Being professional and relentlessly correct will.

- Call for backup where needed.

- Where appropriate, benchmark against the competition (trigger maxis as needed)
> **Contractors have a duty to get in the trenches**

> **Your target audience is the other guys followers**

## Be Consistent, be repetitive. Hammer the message home by relentless reposting and repackaging the same topics with new spins
- When something new shows up (new tech, new analysis etc) rinse it
- Old topics can be recycled (origin story, Upcoming features, Updates on performance)
- Decred team should develop a repo of resources (old reddit posts, papers, research) to draw inspiration from. Start with the aggregator.
- Get Thematic - Every month we emphasise a new topic of Decreds design.

## Two approaches to social

- Simple memetics on repeat - engage the community participation (Buy DCR, #DontSleep… etc). Short, sweet and concise.
- Detailed analysis with intent to trigger believers on the other side. Defend the position until proven wrong.

## Hype the tech, its Grade A+ and compare it to the competition.

- Privacy mixing successes
- Lightning technical developments
- Highlight the skills of the devs (raedah wrote JoinMarket, btcd forked into LND)
- Security design (Zubair, Bucks paper etc)
- Censorship Resistance (PoW/PoS is 2FA, tickets pseudorandom, resistance to ASIC centralisation)



## Key nerves to hit

- Trust → Security, Immutability, Conservative Development, Monetary Policy, Origin story
- Longevity → Self-funded, Outlast competition, Adaptable, Hard Fork resistant, Governance
- Performance → New Ticket high, New Mixing high, data metrics

## Use Matrix for Inspiration

- Paraphrase Dave Collins and JYP et al. insights
- Dig up old Reddits
- Governance talk, Decred success and altcoin failings
- Highlight aligned incentives

Have fun out there. The more unique voices with interesting ideas we have, the faster this thing grows. Be Stakey.

If in doubt, take a look at Bitcoin's marketing strategy.

# Decred Narratives and Memetics

## 1) Store of Value / Financial Instrument

### **Platinum to Bitcoin's gold**: 
DCR iterates on Bitcoin where it meaningfully counts
- Security with Hybrid PoW/PoS and resistance to miner centralisation
- Adaptability with capacity to controlled hard-fork and retain community
- Self-sustaining and resistance to external capture with the treasury

### **Financial Hedge**: 
Bitcoin's design optimises for remaining the same, however, this does have inevitable, high profile instabilities around the need to hard fork. 

The World will not put all their eggs in one digital money basket as software still needs upgrades. Bitcoin's coordination is constrained due to it's pure PoW and node based consensus. Thus, value will need to flow between Bitcoin and an alternative but equally sound protocol. Decred is best placed to fill this role.

### **Symbiosis with Bitcoin**:
Bitcoin is a hardcore organism whose strength is in it's resistance to change.

Decred organism iterates by implementing a hive mind of stake-holders with skin-in-the game. Decred is Bitcoin with a brain.

The Two co-exist and are in fact symbiotic. The patch each other's weaknesses and in combination, there are no sound money gaps to fill. Decred's infrastructure (privacy, LN, DEX, Atomic Swaps) expands the realm of what is possible with Bitcoin.

## 2) Decred's Elegant Design

### **Decred fixes this**
**Bitcoin weaknesses**
- Miner centralisation which is inevitable for PoW (Hybrid PoW/PoS is 2FA).
- Consensus by upgrade leads to many [outdated nodes](http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/security.html?201817144) which are security holes (Soft forks trick old nodes to the new rules via trust in new nodes)
- Central planning committe in Bitcoin Core and Blockstream working to their VC backed agenda of sidechains as a product (hypocrasy of BTSE ICO token) (Every Decred stakeholder decides whether to activate a change to consensus) 
- Subject to external capture by funding (Decred is entirely self-funded)
- Soft Forks are security holes. They are used on Bitcoin to avoid contentious Hard Forks but this constrains development and leads to performance trade-offs. (Decred can controlled Hard Fork whilst maintaining consensus)

**Decred weaknesses**
- Liquidity (MMs are live, Liquidity is thin everywhere, captain obvious BTC is 7yrs older)
