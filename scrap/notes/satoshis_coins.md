Satoshiâ€™s Coins :

They are eventually going to have to move anyway. The crypto will ultimately have to be updated to keep up with new computing hardware. What happens if they aren't moved and there is new hardware that can steal them? Either that, or there will ultimately end up being a hard fork that makes them un-spendable

Well, I mean just think in the future. There are really only 4 options:

 1. Somehow the existing crypto never gets broken the coins never move (highly unlikely -- how many old crypto schemes do you know that can't be broken today?)

 2. The existing crypto has to be updated and the coins have to voluntarily be moved by the Satoshi entity to the new "address" which makes use of the new crypto

 3. The existing crypto has to be updated and the private keys are lost which means ultimately the coins are going to be stolen and moved by the thieves

 4. The consensus rules are changed to make the coins un-spendable thereby breaking the immutability promise


Fairness Launch:

Regarding the whole "fair launch"/pre-mine scenario, I'm continuously amazed at the reasoning given. What is the supposed purpose of having a PoW-only launch? The reason given is that because it offers a "fair" distribution. This argument very quickly falls apart though if you spend just a tiny amount of time thinking about it. Fair for whom? Is it fair for the poor farmer who has never even heard of a GTX1080i? Is it fair if the people who launched it already have purpose-built hidden FPGAs and/or ASICs? Is it more fair that the Satoshi entity effectively pre-mined at least 1M BTC while an airdrop results in stronger decentralization out of the gate? etc.

That is not to say that all pre-mines are fair either, by any means, but the point is that things have to be examined individually and in context.  The whole notion of one being more fair than the other in all cases is really not a defendable position.

If you want to 100% be accurate it means they were specified in the genesis block before launch and therefore PoW had no opportunity to choose to mine a separate chain without it.  However, nowadays, it gets applied to pretty much any scenario where people want to invent something to attack.

I use "pre-mine" in quotes being facetious to those who refuse to think critically about what is good and bad about initial distributions.

Yep, pure PoW is realistically a case of whoever is willing to spend more money gets more.

You can't escape that reality no matter how hard you try to.

It's CPU only mining?  Cool.  You have one, I buy 2.

It's GPU mining?  Cool.  You have 10, I buy 20.

You have ASICs and refuse to sell them?  Cool. I find an engineer and pay to have a faster version built and buy twice as many

This is why I say so often that you have to examine things individually and in context.

When you get right down to the heart of the matter, the entire goal of blindly attacking anything that even can remotely be compared to a pre-mine is to plant the seed that somehow a PoW-only distribution magically results in a more "fair" distribution for some unspecified definition of fair and hoping people don't even notice the sleight of hand that was just perpetrated on them.  Typically that definition of "fair" is really a euphemism for equality of outcome which is anything but fair, but I digress.

At any rate, if you really and truly care about how distributed the coins are, then you really can't claim that X coins going to a single entity via PoW is somehow better than X coins going to Y entities, where Y > 1, via another distribution mechanism, regardless of the specifics of that mechanism.
