## The Cost of Time
A feature where **Decred** differs significantly from the design of **Bitcoin** is in the allocation of 10% of the block subsidy to a network treasury. This capital may be allocated by **Decred** ticket holders towards furthering the project goals and development in an autonomous and self-sustaining manner.

This mechanism carries a number of notable advantages, especially in the long term:

1. **Maximising the protocol's self-sovereignty** via minimising the influence of external parties on project direction. Pure PoW or PoS cryptocurrencies to date have resorted to funding mechanisms such as venture capital raises, initial coin offerings and reliance on donations, all of which have associated constraints such competing ideologies and motivations of backers, compliance and registration with securities law, and slowness of progress (on a donation model).

2. **Incentivises sustained engagement by skilled people** who meaningfully contribute to the project. This grows the pool of DCR holders with skin-in-the-game and enhances resilience of the governance model as these builders are personally motivated to see the protocol succed.

3. **Builds resilience in the development progress** where responsible management of treasury funds during 'good times' can subsequently act as a back-up reserve during downturns to ensure continuued progress.

At the time of writing, the **Decred** treasury is [in the process of migrating](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/c96290a2478d0a1916284438ea2c59a1215fe768a87648d04d45f6b7ecb82c3f) to a fully on-chain wallet custodied by the pool of DCR ticket holders. This iteration in the design essentially nullifies the potential for any individual to access the treasury balance without explicit approval by DCR ticket holders. It is noted that to date no evidence of treasury fund misappropriation has been observed on the public ledger.
