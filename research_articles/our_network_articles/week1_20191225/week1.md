# Our Network - Week 1

## Insight 1 - The Decred Security Curve
The Decred blockchain is secured by a unique Hybrid PoW/PoS consensus mechanism. Each block must be validated by at least 3 out of 5 psuedo-randomly selected PoS tickets. Where a block fails validation, it must be re-mined forfeiting the PoW expendature and block reward. The chart below presents the relative magnitude of honest hashpower required to successfully double spend DCR for a given share of the ticket pool (Y-axis value of 1.0 equates to a standard 51% attack with added cost of holding 50% of tickets).

## Insight 2 - Block Subsidy Models
The Decred protocol issues a block reward split 60% to miners, 30% to stakeholders and 10% to the project treasury. Considered with the hybrid consensus mechanism, Decred functions as a high assurance, triple entry accounting ledger. @PermabullNino released a paper studying this mechanism via the cummulative block reward paid to the PoW/PoS/Fund split. It revealed strong links between the DCR/BTC Price and investor behaviour where the PoS subsidy (purple) has acted as strong support for trend reversals.

## Insight 3 - Miner Squeeze
Similar to the DCR/BTC price which characterises the investor class, block subsidy models priced in USD space are more representative of Miner behaviour. Decred is an ASIC dominated chain and miner costs are denominated in fiat currency. The PoW subsidy line (red) indicates when miner profits are being tested which was recently confirmed by a squeeze in the difficulty ribbon.

## Insight 4 - Politeia in Review





## Insight 5 - Privacy Mixing Performance
Decred rolled out the first phase of it's privacy implementation based on the CoinShuffle++ protocol this August. Privacy mixing is integrated with the PoS Ticket system, given tickets are a consistent denomination, constantly in circulation and pseudo-randomly selected to validate. This makes for a strong and large anonymity set. In the four months since launch, over 20% of the DCR supply has participated in privacy mixing.
