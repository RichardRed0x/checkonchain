# The Bear Case for Ethereum

The Ethereum project has long drawn critiques, especially from Bitcoiners, regarding many facets of its design, execution and failure to deliver what was originally stipulated in the ICO offering. The project is currently attempting the immense engineering challenge of reconstructing an entirely new blockchain followed by integration of the existing chain whilst both are in live operation.

This is no easy feat and highlights irrefutable issues with the original design and continued uncertainties for investors into the future.

At the same time, the project has found a new direction focusing on distributed financial applications supported by, what is positioned as, a ‘moat’ of developer activity. The underlying ethos behind this movement is ‘open and unstoppable finance’ and establishing ETH as the reserve monetary asset of the ecosystem. 

In this article, I will outline a position as to why, despite this movement, the ETH token is unlikely to develop a convincing monetary premium in the competition against fixed supply, deterministically issued cryptocurrencies like BTC. The core arguments will centre around the following topics:

- Uncertainty in monetary policy and centralised governance
- Second system syndrome and persistent project misdirection
- Reliance on the application layer for value accrual
- Underestimation of the ‘tortoise and the hare’ reality of Bitcoin development

## MONETARY POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
The design of Bitcoin’s monetary policy was fixed by code at genesis and is now protected by a firm social contract. It is unlikely to ever change without destroying the project’s fundamental values. This certainty and determinism has shown to attract an impressive monetary premium over Bitcoin’s 11 year history. It instils confidence for market participants on future expectations of inflation and supply.

For Ethereum, the 2014 ICO launch was undertaken with the knowledge of a Proof-of-Stake transition at some stage into the future. As motivation for developer progress towards this goal, the ‘Ice Age’ was baked into the protocol that deliberately reduces block times by winding up PoW difficulty. This acts to disincentivise miners from carrying on with the PoW chain facilitating an easier switch to PoS.

The Ice Age has recently activated for the third time in Ethereum’s history after being delayed on two prior occasions by hard forks in 2017 and 2019. In all cases, a PoS implementation was not ready for deployment and the hard forks have been bundled with a change to the ETH issuance rate.

Ethereum bulls often point to the continual reduction in block rewards as an indication of monetary hardness and increasing scarcity. However the distinction must be made between issuance rate of an asset and the asset’s soundness or resistance to human interference. Whilst the issuance rate indeed appears to reduce in time, the selection of the inflation rate has historically been the product of developer intervention rather than deterministic hard coded changes. 


Bitcoin has previously undergone contentious periods with the most prominent one during the scaling wars over SegWit activation. The User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) movement effectively nullified miner capture of the chain by social consensus and upgrading of user nodes. The Bitcoin node software has always been designed as lightweight to ensure trivial hardware requirements and ease of access.

The most recent Istanbul Hard Fork was executed with barely half the networks nodes in consensus and effectively forked these users off the network. This highlights the governance power relationship of Ethereum is heavily centred on the core developers whom also influence the direction of monetary policy experiments. The latest under discussion, EIP1559 introduces an ETH burn mechanism which again completely shifts the blockchain mechanics and incentive systems of the network.
 

One can only draw a conclusion that the monetary policy of Ethereum is fluid and this uncertainty and relatively centralised governance in the core developers is no doubt a hinderance in Ethereum’s development of a monetary premium.

## SECOND SYSTEM SYNDROME

The original premise of the Ethereum project was to expand on Bitcoin’s feature set by introducing Turing complete scripting capabilities. The design intention was to create a network of global computation, a ‘world computer’. This is in fact a valid design goal and one to which Ethereum is well suited (and designed for) providing a CAPTCHA for a new internet of transactions.

The trade-off from this design decision is an increased protocol complexity, larger attack surface for bugs and hacks, and inevitable blockchain bloat. The design direction of the Ethereum chain has also pivoted a number of times in response to the market demands with shifting narratives from world computer, to unstoppable dAPPS, to a token issuance platform and now to open finance applications. 

It is noted that the original Ethereum design explicitly excluded money as an intended use case for the ETH token.

Whilst this represents a side of innovation and learnings, the design trajectory of the project has shown a continual gravitation towards the Bitcoin design and sole use as a monetary asset. During the time Ethereum has iterated over numerous narratives, Bitcoin’s infrastructure has continued to develop and deliver innovations, enhancing its monetary characteristics, liquidity and network effects. 

Ethereum is in many ways the perfect example of Second System Syndrome. This is where a simple technology like Bitcoin is deemed incapable of meeting its design goals, iterated upon by more complex and ‘promising’ project which is ultimately caught in an endless cycle of research, newly discovered problems and delayed delivery schedules. 

With the rebuild of Ethereum 2.0 under a new consensus mechanism being the latest solution to this problem, it again paints an uncertain future for holders of the ETH token. This new blockchain will ultimately reset any developed Lindy effect from the existing chain and it can be reasonably expected that more research and problems discovered will be the outcome.

## RELIANCE ON THE APPLICATION LAYER FOR VALUE
Whilst the Open finance ecosystem present impressive technological and engineering successes, there remains a lingering risk of over reliance on third party protocols for value accrual to the ETH token. In recent times, a number of high profile ‘unstoppable’ applications including MakerDAO, Compound Finance and 0x have been discovered to have security measures enabling zero delay drains of collateral, developer back-doors and emergency shut-down functions. 

This challenges the ‘unstoppable’ narrative and whilst valid during the early research and development phase, it sounds remarkably like second system syndrome. Perpetual research supporting an ‘almost ready’ development timeline.

The centrepiece of the ‘DeFi’ ecosystem, MakerDAO is driven by the MKR governance token. One can argue that without Maker and the issued DAI/SAI tokens, much of the ‘DeFi’ ecosystem becomes reliant on centralised and permissioned stablecoin infrastructure like USDT and USDC. Furthermore, a vast majority of the ecosystem are reliant on the centrally controlled Maker ETH/USD price oracle which is a problem not easily fixed in a permission-less manner.

A major critique of MKR is the high concentration of tokens in the hands of known, KYC’d venture capitalists and the team themselves. Indeed, a recent proposal passed to reduce the de-central bank interest rate by 4% with 94% of the vote from a single entity. This suggests apathy amongst the voting quorum and strong influence by a small group of large token holders. There is reasonable grounds to assume that MKR is a pseudo-equity type token and is likely to be classified as a financial security under most jurisdictions.

Now given the interrelation between the entire open finance ecosystem and heavy reliance on centralised oracles, one must ask what would happen if Maker and it’s token holders were to be targeted by regulators or nation states? Unregulated issuance of capital loans require banking licenses is most developed nations and this makes the project a prime target for regulators, similar to illicit token issuance during the ICO boom.

Should the value proposition of locking up ETH to power open finance begin to unravel, it would be reasonable to expect that value accrued under this pretence would similarly begin to unwind. Ethereum bulls will argue that smart contracts are native to the protocol and could be forked by a third party. This is true, however it is questionable how many iterations of the new narrative, boom, regulations, bust will investors tolerate until apathy tarnishes future value accrual and the ETH token loses out in competitive landscape.

## THE TORTOISE WINS THE RACE

As a concluding summary, the Ethereum project suffers from a combination of:
- A relatively centralised governance and thus monetary policy system with a history of hard forks with little regard to the consensus of nodes on the network.
- Order of magnitude greater attack surface compared to Bitcoin due to protocol complexity and Turing completeness.
- Persistent changes to narrative and project direction supported by experimental features which over time are consolidating on the Bitcoin narrative of sound money.
- Over-reliance on third party applications, which can be stopped, to accrue value to the ETH token. The non-capped supply and fluidity of monetary policy require it.
- Culmination of second system syndrome in the need for an entire rebuild of the base blockchain and an immense feat of rolling one chain into another. This will take years.

At the end of the day, the reason Ethereum will struggle to develop a monetary policy is simple.

> **Uncertainty and risk perception.**

One could not fault a prospective investor, who is aware of the magnitude, history and depth of the above uncertainties, for being unwilling to part capital in exchange for ETH tokens. The original vision of world computer, in the authors opinion, was the best narrative the project has had and it would be an achievable goal if the direction had not endlessly pivoted. 

The issue is that the outcome is a smaller addressable market when compared to a monetary asset like Bitcoin and thus the narrative gradually shifts towards ‘ETH is money’.

The author challenges readers to consider how far advanced Bitcoin is in achieving the goals of sound, immutable money whilst Ethereum has ventured down numerous dead end rabbit holes. There is a general misunderstanding of the potential of systems like Lightning network and sidechains to enhancing the capabilities of Bitcoin as a global reserve asset.

Intuitively, building an immensely secure and immutable base layer with the sole purpose of transaction settlement makes sense. Indeed, this is what the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain is designed to do, finality and settlement only, no bloat. 2.0 shards simply replicate what Bitcoin second layer solutions achieve however without the liquidity, reputation and security premium that Bitcoin has developed.
